new types:
    i8       => char
    i16      => short
    i32      => int
    i64      => long long
    isize    => long long
    u8       => unsigned char
    u16      => unsigned short
    u32      => unsigned int
    u64      => unsigned long long
    usize    => unsigned long long
    f32      => float
    f64      => double
    bool     => _Bool

new keyword:
    owned(T) => (T*)malloc(sizeof(T))   (must be assigned to T&)

new syntax:
    T&       => T*                      (scoped T ptr; free call is inserted at end of scope, unless ptr is already moved to function taking T&)
    ~T()     => _T_free(T*)             (destructors, inserted in place of free calls for objects with one defined)
    struct T => typedef struct {} T     (typedef struct {} T; is not necessary)
